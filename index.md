## Beginner Umbraco tutorials for developers

### Umbraco 7 Developer Tutorials

            This is a set of beginner tutorials for new Umbraco developers. This is NOT official Umbraco documentation.
            You can find official documentation at [our.umbraco.org](http://our.umbraco.org).  Also note that since
            these tutorials are written by a beginner, they might not necessarily follow best practices.
            I welcome any changes to this documentation through the
            [github repo](https://github.com/mkimmet/Umbraco-Developer-Tutorials). The tutorials will walk
            you through the set up of Umbraco 7 and then create a simple custom form that submits
            data into an Umbraco Document Type.  They will also create a simple dashboard to view the
            submitted data without logging into the Umbraco admin portal.

*   [Tutorial #3 - Creating and Storing Data in Umbraco](Tutorial-3-Storing-data-in-Umbraco.html)

            At this point I am still working on the tutorials, and I will update this site as each tutorial is finished.
